Fantomex was created by the Weapon Plus Program to serve as a super-sentinel against Earth's mutant population. Through experimentation with human-machine hybridization, Weapon Plus created a population of technorganic organisms whose living tissue was fused with Sentinel nanotechnology at the cellular level.

## Intro

Fantomex is a lib for storing a relatively small number of background jobs in
a persistent queue.  It's designed as a way for a single ZeroMQ worker to queue
messages.
